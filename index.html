		<p>He came, he shouted obscenities, he pretended to throw a chair and, eventually, after so much tired hoopla, he conquered. Boy did he conquer. In the fourth minute of the second round of his contest with Eddie Alvarez at Madison Square Garden, Conor McGregor hit the 32-year-old with the same left hook that he’d been tormenting him with since the contest began. Alvarez hit the floor with a thud and when the Dubliner pounced to try to inflict further damage the referee John McCarthy intervened to stop it.
    </p>
			<p> When he did, McGregor became the new UFC lightweight champion and, as the reigning featherweight, the first to simultaneously hold titles in two divisions. His trainer John Kavanagh has said he thinks 155lbs is his charge’s best fighting weight and on this evidence that’s indisputable. Aside from an Alvarez leg kick that appeared to hurt him in the opening exchanges, he was in complete control of the bout. He was simply faster, more powerful and using his greater reach to almost toy with his opponent.
