  <h1>Tone Woods - The London Guitar Studio</h1>
  <br>
  <h1>Top Woods</h1>
  <h2>Spruce</h2>
  <h3>Spruce is a perennial favourite as it suits any style of playing. Various species are used including Sitka (the most common), Engelmann and Adirondack with all species being light and strong, qualities which result in a high velocity of sound. Spruce is creamy white to pinky light brown in colour but does tend to tan across time and so older instruments can take on a yellow hue which can be mimicked in new guitars by using an aging toner to create an aged appearance.</h3>
  <h3>All varieties of spruce will produce a broad dynamic range with crisp and immediate sound. This wood gives a strong tone with little overtone resulting in a direct, powerful and uncomplicated sound that suits a variety of playing styles. Spruce can be played hard without diminishing the clarity of the sound but can lack character when played softly and this is particularly true of Sitka. Engelmann is a lighter, more flexible wood providing more depth and Adirondack can be worked even harder than Sitka whilst retaining clarity and balance. Adirondack is considered to be the ideal top wood but it is costly and can lack consistency in the grain and colour. The yield is low as the trees are much smaller than Alaskan Sitka which are huge specimens that result in a high yield and therefore a lower price.</h3>
  <h3>Spruce soundboards are a great choice for all round players who require a single instrument for a variety of styles. Engelmann should be favoured by players with a light touch and Adirondack for more aggressive strumming. The following video from Collings Guitars provides some great insight into the properties of spruce.</h3>
  <br>
  <h2>Cedar</h2>
  <h3>This wood is traditionally used on classical instruments but is becoming an increasingly popular choice for steel strung flat top constructions too. Cedar is a darker wood than spruce and ranges from cinnamon to light chocolate in hue. It is a less dense wood than spruce and produces a warmer, more complex sound with a higher ratio of overtone to fundamental. Cedar produces a tone with less clarity, snap and sparkle but with more character. Less stiffness along the grain means that cedar is quieter than many woods and loses clarity when played hard. It is the choice of those who value character and warmth over clarity and volume.</h3>
  <h3>It should be noted at this point that cedar tops tend to open up much quicker than those fashioned from spruce. Spruce tops can require playing in for months or even years before they reach their true potential whereas a cedar top will produce rich harmonics and a warm tone even when new.</h3>
  <h3>As Cedar lacks clarity at high volume but posseses a wonderful richness of tone it is favoured by musicians with a light touch.</h3>
  <br>
  <h1>Back and Sides</h1>
  <h3>Guitar backs and sides are generally made from the same wood and that wood is chosen for its ability to eliminate or amplify the frequencies produced by the top of the instrument. The backs and sides therefore have a great influence on the tone of the guitar. The combination of woods chosen for the tops, sides and back must be carefully considered to achieve the desired results.</h3>
  <br>
  <h2>Rosewood</h2>
  <h3>Rosewood is a popular and enduring choice for acoustic guitars and there are two varieties to consider - Indian rosewood and the more costly Brazilian rosewood. Brazilian rosewood has a luxurious look with a dark brown hue which can feature orange shades. The striking figuring gives a more luxurious appearance than Indian rosewood and the Brazilian variety is highly valued for its quality of tone but there are now trade restrictions on this wood making the Indian rosewood, which is easier to produce, a far cheaper option.</h3>
  <h3>Both varieties of rosewood are renowned for sparkly notes. There is great clarity across the frequencies and the wood produces a more metallic sound than the woody tone of mahogany and offers a tight bass projection that does not overpower the sparkle of the mid range and the sizzle of the top notes. There is an ongoing debate as to the relative merits of the Brazilian and Indian varieties with perhaps some of the praise heaped on the former being attributable to its rarity and heritage values. Both varieties produce a consistent tone which suits a wide range of styles and for this reason rosewood is often paired with a spruce top to produce a great all-rounder.</h3>
  <br>
  <h2>Mahogany</h2>
  <h3>The rich, dark red hues of mahogany are easy to spot. It is a dense, stiff wood that produces a distinctive woody and warm tone with the emphasis on the mid range rather than the pronounced highs and lows of rosewood. As mahogany matures and after it is played in, a more prominent overtone appears adding character. This wood is well suited to blues and roots music and overall provides a punchier and darker sound than rosewood. The combination of mahogany back and sides with a spruce top is common as this partnership is one of great balance and versatility.</h3>
  <br>
  <h2>Solid or Laminated?</h2>
  <h3>You will find that cheaper guitars are fashioned from laminated wood and more costly models from solid wood. Laminated wood is basically formed by fusing layers of cheaper wood and then adding a decent wood veneer. This material is much cheaper to use than solid wood but produces an inferior tone. Laminated wood will also deteriorate over time. Solid wood is the best option if you have the budget for it but you should be aware that solid wood can vary greatly in quality and the higher grades will be used on the more costly instruments. If your budget is tight then you could opt for an instrument with a solid top and laminated back and sides as this is a good compromise.</h2>
